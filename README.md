In this Project, I have analyzed survey data from data professionals to uncover valuable insights about the data industry. These findings shed light on the satisfaction levels of data professionals with their compensation and work-life balance. One of the most interesting aspects was the favorite programming languages among data professionals, with python and R being the top choices. This Interactive Powerr BI dashboard beautifully visualizes the survey data from about 578 participants, allowing us to delve into the findings in a comprehensive way.

This Project aims to explore different kinds of House Sales from May 2014 to 2015 within King County to improve the company's regional sales.The dashboard Features two histograms focusing on the frequency of bathrooms and bedrooms per house. Another Histogram shows the distribution of house prices in dollars, with a heatmap showing the average price based on the view and condition of the house. These four chartscan be filtered based on the selected month and day from the calendar, along with sliders filtering on the house's year of construction along with square footage for the living spaces and lot. The final two charts,a line chart showing daily average house sales price and a map with average price by Yip code, can only be filtered by month. These filters allow the company to be as precise as possible when reviewing sales across the county.

# [Project 3:Revenue Realizations_Insights for the Hospitality Domain's Revenue Team: Project Overview](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzE1OTQwNmQtOTNlYy00ODFmLWJiNmItMWYwNjkwMDc0ZWYxIiwidCI6ImM2ZTU0OWIzLTVmNDUtNDAzMi1hYWU5LWQ0MjQ0ZGM1YjJjNCJ9)

AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in India's hospitality sector for two decades, faces market challenges. To counter declining market share and revenue, the managing director plans to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence."

As an aspiring data analyst, I undertook a critical project for AtliQ Grands, a leading player in India's hospitality sector. Faced with declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to strategic competitor moves and management decision challenges, the managing director initiated a strategic shift towards "Business and Data Intelligence." Given the absence of an in-house data analytics team, the revenue management team opted to engage a third-party service provider for insights.

My role involved leveraging sample data and a mock-up dashboard to address this challenge. I meticulously created metrics aligned with the provided metric list, crafted a dashboard as per stakeholder mock-ups, and went beyond expectations by generating additional insights not covered in the initial metric list or dashboard design. This project showcases my ability to transform data into actionable insights, fulfill stakeholder expectations.
