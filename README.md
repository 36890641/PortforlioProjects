In this Project, I have analyzed survey data from data professionals to uncover valuable insights about the data industry. These findings shed light on the satisfaction levels of data professionals with their compensation and work-life balance. One of the most interesting aspects was the favorite programming languages among data professionals, with python and R being the top choices. This Interactive Powerr BI dashboard beautifully visualizes the survey data from about 578 participants, allowing us to delve into the findings in a comprehensive way.

This Project aims to explore different kinds of House Sales from May 2014 to 2015 within King County to improve the company's regional sales.The dashboard Features two histograms focusing on the frequency of bathrooms and bedrooms per house. Another Histogram shows the distribution of house prices in dollars, with a heatmap showing the average price based on the view and condition of the house. These four chartscan be filtered based on the selected month and day from the calendar, along with sliders filtering on the house's year of construction along with square footage for the living spaces and lot. The final two charts,a line chart showing daily average house sales price and a map with average price by Yip code, can only be filtered by month. These filters allow the company to be as precise as possible when reviewing sales across the county.
